This is a story about Aaksh and his life at UW-Madison. He is born in Indian
but brought up in Thailand. He had a good high school life; however, now goes
to UW-Madison.
When Aaksh came to UW-Madison, he loved it here. He made some really incredible friends
and became close with them. When Aaksh was with his friends one day, one of them, Joshua, 
came up with a good idea about a musical telegram. Aaksh and Joshua thought about their
idea and decided to move forward with it.

Soon after the decision, they bought some equipment and lent a small room near the campus.
However, no one loves their telegram, and they have no audience.
They think it is time to make some revolution.
